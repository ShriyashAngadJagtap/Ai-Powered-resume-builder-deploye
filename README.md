Unlike my previous builds, this oneâ€™s special because I integrated AI (Gemini API) into it.

 Itâ€™s a Full Stack MERN Web App that helps you build a resume instantly with the help of AI.

Just upload your old resume, and the AI automatically extracts your skills, experience, and profile summary, then generates a clean, professional resume layout in seconds.

  Tech Stack: MongoDB | Express.js | React.js | Node.js | Gemini AI

  Features:

 â€¢ AI-generated summary & skill extraction

 â€¢ Resume parsing from uploaded files

 â€¢ Real-time editing & preview

 â€¢ Responsive, modern UI

This project helped me dive deeper into AI integration, API handling, and frontend-backend coordination in real-world scenarios.

 Iâ€™m really proud of how it turned out! ðŸš€
